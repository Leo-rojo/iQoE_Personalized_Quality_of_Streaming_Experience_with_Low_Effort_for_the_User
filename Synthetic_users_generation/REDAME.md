## Generate synthetic users, synthetic scores and features for synthetic experiences:
* The folder 'original_waterlooIV_dataset' contains the original waterloo dataset.
* Run Save_features_and_user_scores_W4.py in order to generate 'all_feat_hdtv.npy' and 'users_scores_hdtv.npy' which contains respectively the features and the scores of real hdtv users of the original dataset. Put the 'users_scores_hdtv.npy' outside the folder.
* Run 'creation_of_features_for_synthetic_users.py' inside folder 'features_for_synthetic_user_fitting'  to generate various files containing different collection of features for the generated videostreaming experience. Each collection is used by different QoE models for generating the synthetic users.
* Run 'fitting_of_models_to_real_users.py' to generate synthetic users that gives unbounded scores, the output files will be saved in Fitted_models_without_logistic
* Run 'Bound_with_logistic' which generate the sigmoid parameters for each synthetich users, so to bound their scores into a scale [1,100]. The output files are stored in 'save_param_sigmoids'
* Run 'Synthetic_users_give_score_to_generated_experiences.py' in order to obtain the scores for the generated experiences. The output files produced are: a series of npy files called feat_qoemodel_for_synth_exp.npy containing the features for each different qoemodel used for synthetic user building, the scores given by the synthetic users in 'synthetic_users_scores_for_generated_experiences' and the iQoE features for the generated experiences in 'features_generated_experiences'.
